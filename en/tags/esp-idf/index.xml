      <description>Having thoroughly understood how Power Profiler Kit 2 (PPK2) works, I decided to test power consumption under different conditions. In fact, lora-at is not such a simple application. It works with bluetooth and the sx127x chip, processes commands from the UART bus and has a deep sleep mode. So there is a plenty of things to look for.&#xA;Measurement methodology Before you start measuring something, you need to decide how it will be measured.</description>

      <description>Background It&amp;rsquo;s been too long since my last post about LoRa. During this time, I created a project lora-at, which I would like to write about in this post. But before I deep dive into the meety details, I little background on how it started.&#xA;Initially, I planned to create a small firmware for receiving signals from satellites using LoRa protocol. I used tinyGS as a basis, which did almost everything I needed.</description>
