      <description>In the previous post I described the general design of r2lora and selected tools for development. Now we can focus on configuring the project and breaking it down into individual modules. PlatformIO integrates well with a variety of different tools and allows you to do complex things almost as easily as in Java.&#xA;Dependency Management A challenge in every C/C++ project is dependency management. There is no standard way to handle this in the language and ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Recently, I came across the very first version of the RaspberryPi, and I decided to experiment a bit with this old hardware.&#xA;I was curious about how the performance of the volk library would differ depending on various compilation flags.&#xA;arm1176jzf-s Firstly, it is necessary to determine the processor. As known, RaspberryPi uses a system-on-the-chip (SoC) from Broadcom. It is even written on the processor itself: Broadcom BCM2835. Inside this chip, there are several logical components:</description>

      <description>15 years ago, nobody had even heard of unit tests. We just wrote the code once and then relied on manual QA and our sharp eyes to check for any issues. We all lived in perfect harmony and peace. But then came along those damn unit tests, and suddenly the world was split into two warring factions: those who write tests and those who don&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;Spoiler alert: I&amp;rsquo;m on team auto-tests.</description>
