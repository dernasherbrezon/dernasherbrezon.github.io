      <description>Continuing work on the new sx127x library, I decided to add Linux support, specifically for Raspberry Pi. Besides the practical need, I wanted to understand how programming for microcontrollers differs from regular operating systems.
I designed the library quite well from the beginning, so migrating to Linux required only a few changes:
 Abandoning esp_err.h and using return codes of type int Separating SPI operations into a separate header and redefining for different platforms.</description>

      <description>One of the fundamental questions that every programmer must periodically answer is &amp;ldquo;whether to use existing library or write your own.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to give a definitive answer to this question once and for all. You have to sit down and analyze each specific case. Recently, I faced such a situation, as I described in my previous post, where I explained how I reduced the LoRa current consumption to 16mA. If the goal is just to experiment and test some theory about the hardware, it was enough to modify the source code of existing arduino-LoRa.</description>
