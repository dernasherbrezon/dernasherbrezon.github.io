      <description>Having thoroughly understood how Power Profiler Kit 2 (PPK2) works, I decided to test power consumption under different conditions. In fact, lora-at is not such a simple application. It works with bluetooth and the sx127x chip, processes commands from the UART bus and has a deep sleep mode. So there is a plenty of things to look for.&#xA;Measurement methodology Before you start measuring something, you need to decide how it will be measured.</description>

      <description>After I re-wrote lora-at in C, I reduced the size of the firmware by half! However, although this looks impressive, it is actually not that important. If both versions fit on a chip, then size doesn&amp;rsquo;t make too much difference. Energy consumption is another matter. Low power consumption is important when operating from solar panels. That is why I decided to explore this topic in more detail.&#xA;Previously, I used the A3-B USB tester, but it is not suitable for measuring current consumption in microcontrollers.</description>
