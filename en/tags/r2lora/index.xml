      <description>Not long ago, I acquired a USB tester A3-B.&#xA;This device allows measuring the current and voltage flowing between the USB input and USB output. One end can be plugged into a charger, the other into a device, and the current consumption can be measured. There are numerous applications for this:&#xA;Measure current consumption in different modes: Sleep Active work Standby Measure consumption over time. The display can switch to a graphing mode, showing how consumption changes over a period.</description>

      <description>This post continues the development cycle of the r2lora project. Previous articles:&#xA;Creating a project for ESP32 Setting up a project in PlatformIO FOTA is an abbreviation for Firmware-Over-The-Air. This is a special component that updates the application if a new version is available.&#xA;Design Auto-update can be done in several ways:&#xA;The special component starts listening on TCP/UDP port. To update, you need to send the firmware to this port from any other device running on the network.</description>

      <description>In the previous post I described the general design of r2lora and selected tools for development. Now we can focus on configuring the project and breaking it down into individual modules. PlatformIO integrates well with a variety of different tools and allows you to do complex things almost as easily as in Java.&#xA;Dependency Management A challenge in every C/C++ project is dependency management. There is no standard way to handle this in the language and ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Recently, the LoRa data transmission protocol has been gaining popularity. Several satellites actively use it, and there is a whole network for signal reception - tinyGS. Of course, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t miss such a trend, so I started exploring how to connect the LoRa protocol to r2cloud. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s a closed protocol, so you can&amp;rsquo;t demodulate it with the standard rtl-sdr. To receive the signal, you need to use a special chip that will output a ready-made packet.</description>
