      <title>CPU-specific APT repositories</title>

      <description>Interesting fact - all applications located in the standard Debian or Ubuntu repositories are compiled with default options. This leads to interesting consequences. For example, programmers do not use SIMD instructions and rely on the compiler. The compiler cannot always optimize the code for a specific processor. As a result, all the super-fast capabilities of processors and incredible SIMD operations are not used.
Debian developers explain this feature by stating that enabling support for extended registers does not provide significant acceleration.</description>

      <title>Monitor Mikrotik routers using Prometheus</title>

      <description>To begin with, a few words about why it is necessary to monitor routers. A router, like any other device, has hardware resources that can become depleted. For example, the browser may become slower in opening pages or videos may take longer to load. This can be caused by either the internet service provider or the router. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that too many devices are connected to the router, causing it to slow down, or someone may be downloading excessively in parallel - all of this can be the reason for the slowdown.</description>

      <title>Fat and thin distributions</title>

      <description>This week, I finally migrated all my projects to Ubuntu 18.04 and thin .deb distributions. I started this project at the beginning of the year and completed it only now, almost 8 months later. The migration itself deserves a separate article with complaints and rhetorical questions. Here, I want to briefly describe the confrontation between thin and fat distributions, share my perspective on this story, and provide some analysis. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in!</description>

      <title>Distributing Java application</title>

      <description>Surprisingly, but a fact - distributing Java applications in the 21st century is still a huge hassle. Developers still come up with methods like rsync/copy-paste/wget to install Java applications on servers. And only monstrous enterprise production-ready platforms sometimes allow a bit more - rolling back the application to a previous version. In this article, I would like to talk about an accessible and straightforward way of organizing distribution.
deb Ð¸ apt In the world, there are many truly gigantic repositories of applications and tools for their distribution.</description>
